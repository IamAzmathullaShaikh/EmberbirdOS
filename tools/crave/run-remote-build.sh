#!/usr/bin/env bash
# EmberbirdOS - launch the M2 X2 guest build on Crave, then pull the results back.
#
# WHY THERE IS A SCRIPT FOR THIS
#   Crave resolves the project *from the git URL of the current directory*. This
#   repository's URL is not a Crave project, so running `crave run` from a plain checkout
#   fails with:
#
#     Error: could not get project information for <this repo>
#
#   (A project is not needed and is deliberately not created: M2's provenance anchor is
#   the X1 lock, not a Crave project. The base project is only a container.)
#
#   So the job is launched from a throwaway checkout - a "ticket" - whose origin IS the
#   base project's source URL, and the job bootstraps this repository inside the remote
#   workspace at the exact commit you are standing on. That keeps the build reproducible
#   from any machine with the client and an API key.
#
# USAGE
#   bash tools/crave/run-remote-build.sh run      # launch (default), detached
#   bash tools/crave/run-remote-build.sh status   # queue state + tail of the log
#   bash tools/crave/run-remote-build.sh log      # full remote log
#   bash tools/crave/run-remote-build.sh watch    # poll until the job runs, then pull
#   bash tools/crave/run-remote-build.sh pull     # fetch image/out/* back into this repo
#   bash tools/crave/run-remote-build.sh stop     # stop the job on this workspace
#
# `watch` exists because a free-queue job can sit `queued` for a long time waiting for a
# build node (observed 2026-09-24 on linux16 - the free queue costs no tokens, it is just
# a wait for capacity), and a multi-hour sync+build follows even once it starts. It polls,
# records the state, and pulls the artifact the moment the job reports success - see WATCH_INTERVAL.
#
# TUNABLES (env)
#   CRAVE_PROJECT_ID     default 36 (LOS 20 - Crave's Android 13 AOSP base)
#   CRAVE_PROJECT_NAME   default "LOS 20"
#   CRAVE_PROJECT_URL    default https://github.com/accupara/los20.git
#   CRAVE_PLATFORM       default linux16  (the only capable platform project 36 accepts;
#                                          see docs/M2-CRAVE-BUILD.md for the probe matrix)
#   COMMIT               default: current HEAD of this checkout (pinned into the job)
#   TICKET_DIR           default $TEMP/crave-ticket-<project name slug>  (e.g. "LOS 20"
#                        -> crave-ticket-los20). Keyed to the PROJECT, not a bare id, and
#                        stable per project so the client's Workspace-Dir-derived build
#                        cache is not silently reset between runs (more-info.md lists
#                        Workspace Dir as one of the 4 things that reset build storage).
#   ATTACH=1             stream the build in the foreground instead of detaching
#   JOB                  job id to watch (default: read from image/out/crave-job.txt)
#   WATCH_INTERVAL       seconds between polls in `watch` mode (default 300)
#
# WORKSPACE SCOPING (observed 2026-09-24): the client resolves getlog/pull against the
# CURRENT DIRECTORY's workspace, and that resolution returned "No running job found on
# this workspace" even when run from the job's own registered ticket dir while `list`
# still showed the job queued. So every log/artifact access in `watch`/`pull`/`log` is
# PINNED with an explicit --jobID/--job (resolved from $JOB or image/out/crave-job.txt),
# which the client honors regardless of cwd. TICKET_DIR still matters for `pull` (it is
# the local staging root the remote eb/image/out/ lands in before the copy into the repo).
#
# Everything goes through tools/crave/crave.sh, so the client's broken self-update path
# (docs/CRAVE-CLIENT-UPDATE-LOOP.md) is never entered.

# Three problems the old `cp -f crave.yaml` had:
#   1. It overwrote whatever crave.yaml the base project ships (a real risk: its config
#      keys env:/image:/push: for the *build node*, which we must not silently discard).
#   2. Our file is keyed by project NAME ("LOS 20"). Crave matches the block by the
#      dashboard project name, so on a project switch (e.g. --projectID 93 = LOS 22.1)
#      the "LOS 20" block never applies and the ignoreClientHostname/no-patch overrides
#      vanish with no warning - exactly what happened on the 301767 run.
#   3. more-info.md: for repo-based trees the file's real home is
#      [Workspace Dir]/.repo/manifests/crave.yaml, not the checkout top.
#
# So: (a) fail loudly if our overrides are not keyed to the project we are launching, and
# (b) MERGE our keys into the base project's file (preserving its own top-level keys and
# any per-project block) rather than overwriting it, writing to whichever location the
